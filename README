Here's a brief overview of how Torshammer works:

Threaded Requests: Torshammer uses multiple threads to send a large number of HTTP requests to a target website simultaneously. Threads allow the tool to generate a high volume of traffic quickly.

TOR Proxies: The tool leverages the Tor network to anonymize the source of the traffic. This is done by routing the requests through different Tor exit nodes, making it difficult to trace the origin of the attack.

HTTP GET Requests: Torshammer typically employs HTTP GET requests, a common method for fetching resources from a web server. By sending a large number of these requests in a short period, the tool aims to overload the target's resources.



Tor's Hammer is a slow post dos testing tool written in Python. It can also be run through the Tor network to be anonymized. If you are going to run it with Tor it assumes you are running Tor on 127.0.0.1:9050. Kills most unprotected web servers running Apache and IIS via a single instance. Kills Apache 1.X and older IIS with ~128 threads, newer IIS and Apache 2.X with ~256 threads.
